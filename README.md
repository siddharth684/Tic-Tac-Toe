# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is  a Tic tac toe game but slightly different from the normal one. You can decide how many playerd can play the game (from 2-5).
You can decide how many signs you need horizontaly or vertically aligned to win.
you can decide the lenght and bredth of the board.
I saw this program in a youtube video but they didn't show it how it's made.
It's not complete yet because I am stuck on a part where the program has to show the winner.
